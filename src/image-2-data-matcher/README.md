image-2-data-matcher
===============

Code that can match images to the data acquired on the plane. This program is a WIP and may have different versions for different systems depending on how this is managed.
Ideally this should use both the timestamp in the image's exif metadata and the time that the plane records sending the signal to take a picture plus whatever delay that exists between when the signal is sent to the camera and when the camera takes the photograph.
