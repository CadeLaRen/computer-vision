image-2-data-matcher
===============

A program that can match images to the data acquired on the plane. This program is a WIP and may have different versions for different systems depending on how this is managed.
This should also calculate potential errors based on the GPS lock, speed of the aircraft, as well as roll/pitch/yaw angles.
